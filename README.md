# DataSpaces_Tesina
Tesina for DataSpaces course @ Polito

# Aim of the Tesina
The aim of this tesina is to analyze a certain Breast Cancer Dataset (took from here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29) to determine whether a certain patient has banign or malignant cancer. 

Rough Summary of Tesina is available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CkyFGS5KMiWlv5zkR2MUJLqmtMwSW5zF5HJowZUE0w4/edit

# TODO - practical -
- Implement pair plots - ok
- Dataset Analysis - Univariate & Multivariate - ok
- Undersample training set - ok (better than oversample with kfold)
- Parameter tuning for algorithms
- see sensitivity and specificity values
- plot results of classification - ok
- describe methods used in a better way and with explanation on how they work and comparison between results obtained
- Ask professor about dataset choice - changed to bigger dataset - ok
- Final rework & refactor with functions & stuff

# TODO - study better in order to be able to explain 
- interpret pair plots
- Analysis methods - ok
- KNN - ok
- Logistic regression
- Random Forest (ripasso)
- SVM
