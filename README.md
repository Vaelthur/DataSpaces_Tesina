# Aim of the Tesina
The aim of this tesina is to analyze a certain Breast Cancer Dataset (took from here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Coimbra) to determine whether a certain patient has or not breast cancer, based on some values and parameters collected from blood analysis. 

Rough Summary of Tesina is available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CkyFGS5KMiWlv5zkR2MUJLqmtMwSW5zF5HJowZUE0w4/edit

- Dataset Analysis - Univariate & Multivariate - ok
- see sensitivity and specificity values 
- describe methods used in a better way and with explanation on how they work and comparison between results obtained
- Ask professor about dataset choice

# TODO - study better in order to be able to explain 
- Analysis methods - ok
- Logistic regression
- Random Forest (ripasso)
- SVM
