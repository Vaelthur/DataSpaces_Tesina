# DataSpaces_Tesina
Tesina for DataSpaces course @ Polito

# Aim of the Tesina
The aim of this tesina is to analyze a certain Breast Cancer Dataset (took from here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Coimbra) to determine whether a certain patient has or not breast cancer, based on some values and parameters collected from blood analysis. 

TODO: update with techniques used and if i will use other datsets.
